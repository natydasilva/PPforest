\title{For each bootstrap sample grow a projection pursuit tree (PPtree object).}
\usage{
baggtree(
  data,
  class,
  m = 500,
  PPmethod = "LDA",
  lambda = 0.1,
  size.p = 1,
  parallel = FALSE,
  cores = 2
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{Data frame with the complete data set.}

\item{class}{A character with the name of the class variable.}

\item{m}{is the number of bootstrap replicates, this corresponds with the number of trees to grow. To ensure that each observation is predicted a few times we have to select this number no too small. \code{m = 500} is by default.}

\item{PPmethod}{is the projection pursuit index to be optimized, options LDA or PDA, by default it is LDA.}

\item{lambda}{a parameter for PDA index}

\item{size.p}{proportion of random sample variables in each split.}

\item{parallel}{logical condition, if it is TRUE then  parallelize the function}

\item{cores}{number of cores used in the parallelization}
}
\value{
data frame with trees_pp output for all the bootstraps samples.
}
\description{
For each bootstrap sample grow a projection pursuit tree (PPtree object).
